Q1
class HasCapacity f where
capacity :: f a -> Int
example :: f a -> Maybe a
-- Laws: ∀x. capacity > 0 ==> isJust (example)

which of the following instance declarations are fine?
Mark these either as True or False:
   instance HasCapacity Int where ...         F
   instance HasCapacity Either where ...      F
   instance HasCapacity (Either String) where ...  T
   instance HasCapacity (Either String Int) where ... F

Q3
Functors have laws. Which of the following would be law-abiding fmaps for
data Counter a = Counter a Int?
Mark these either as True or False:
    fmap f (Counter a n) = Counter (f a) 0      F
    fmap f (Counter a n) = Counter (f a) (n+1)  F
    fmap f (Counter a n) = Counter a (f n)      T
    fmap f (Counter a n) = Counter (f a) n      T

Q4
Which of these are functions?
Mark these either as True or False:
    Remove consecutive duplicates from a list   T
    Read contents of a file                     F
    Sort a list                                 T
    Get the current date                        F
    Fetch a web page as a String                F

Funktion tulos samalla syötteellä on aina sama. Esim päivämäärä
on joka päivä eri.

Q5
What does this print:
main =
 print (length [putStr "kissa ",putStr "istuu ",putStr "aidalla"])

Mark these either as True or False:
    3 kissa istuu aidalla    F
    kissa istuu aidalla 3    F
    kissa istuu aidalla      F
    3                        T
    aidallaistuu kissa       F

Tulostaa annetun listan pituuden, joka on 3.

Q7
Which of these can be implemented? (without resorting to unsafe behaviour)
Mark these either as True or False:
    forall a. a -> IO a
    forall a. IO a -> a
    forall a b. IO (a->b,a) -> b
    forall a b. IO (a->b,a) -> IO b
    forall a b. IO a -> IO (a->b) -> IO b

Q6
Which of these is a program that reads a line from the user and prints it back in reverse?

Mark these either as True or False:
    main = print (reverse getLine)
    main = print (fmap reverse getLine)
    main = reverse getLine >>= print
    main = fmap reverse getLine >>= print

Q8
Picture has two functions, labeled A and B.
The function f is given to them as an argument.

Mark these either as True or False:
    A traverses the list atleast once, regardless of f  T
    B traverses the list atleast once, regardless of f  F
